Backyard Pizza Jam
Pop-up Pizza at your house

WHAT IS BACKYARD PIZZA JAM
Backyard Pizza Jam is a pop-up pizza place at your house. Well technically in your backyard. A participatory, improvisational experience involving lots of melted cheese. We will transform your backyard into a world-class pizza restuarant before your very eyes. 

HOW IT WORKS
Before your event we'll help you plan out a menu of pizza types, topping combos and side dishes. The day of we'll bring everything you need to have an incredible dining experience: 700 degree pizza ovens, slow-fermented dough, fresh toppings & sauces.
Top your own pies, try your hand at tossing dough, or kick back and let us take care of everything. Either way we'll man the ovens and your guests will enjoy fantastic pies in the comfort of your own backyard.
